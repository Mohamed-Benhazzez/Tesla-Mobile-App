# Tesla Mobile App
An example app replicating some of the functionality of the official Tesla Mobile App. The example is Xamarin Forms but for the moment I have only chosen to develop for Windows 10 Mobile (Univeral Windows Platform).

In order to help build my Exrin framework, I wanted to build an app that would be functionally complete (sans API). Because I love Tesla, Xamarin Forms, Mobile Apps and communicating with real world objects, this app seemed like a perfect fit for a sample.
